		<English>The development of nanotechnology eventually lead to the ability to flawlessly connect the human nervous system to mechanical systems. This inevitably leads to the ability to communicate with computer systems to both control them and receive information from them directly without the need for other controls or data displays. Such interfaces allow starship crews to "see" using the ship sensors - and also hear, smell, taste, and touch via mapping various sensor systems to the various senses - allowing for the rapid interpretation of data and a reduced time to act on the data. All warships rapidly convert to using direct mind-machine controls (known as the Neural Interface), giving a small but useful increase to their combat capabilities. This specific development also allows a greatly improved  ability to repair damage to the nervous system, greatly improved mechanical prosthetics, and the ability to connect cloned body parts to the body perfectly so that it is difficult even to detect that such a replacement has been made.</English>

		<English>The first practical advancement gained from the study of quantum control turns out to be the very important invention of power supplies that work by, essentially, converting matter directly to energy. This improves the power systems of starships allowing them to more easily produce the negative energy used to propel them and also to produce more power for all other systems including weapons. A byproduct of all this is the new Q-Missile, which has better characteristics (for a missile) than either the [ICON_POWER] anti-ship missile or the [ICON_POWER] assault missile, making both of them obsolete.</English>

		<English>As the full extent of the knowledge in the Lambda-VC beacon was determined, the research that was intended to lead to the full and accurate transcription of the human mind into a computer was persued. The improving nanotechnology used in the mind-machine interface, medicine, and cybernetics combined with the miniaturization of quantum power systems lead to the next step closer to the goal of effecive immortality for humans. Using nanotechnological cybernetic systems, whether embeded in the existing body parts or replacing them entirely, it becomes possible to heal nearly any injury and enhance the capabilities of people to what used to be considered super-human levels. This can be done for both the physical capabilities and the mind, via tightly integrated nanocomputer sysems which enhance memory, mathematical calculations, and a variety of other capabilities via the use of the same sorts of technology developed with the Intuative Computers technology running the Extended Range Systems algorithms. Some beleive that integrating computer systems into the human mind is contrary to the goal of copying the mind into a computer, in part because the continued advancement of the computer technologies makes it even harder to define what is supposed to be copied into the computer. With the realization that it is already possible to use nanotech assembers to build a complete cybernetic body, some researchers join together in a direct attempt to complete the ELO's Human Consciousness Project and create a purely constructed human including the complete and accurate transcription of a human mind, as it currently exists, into its cybernetic brain.

		<English>Important for production of cloth, cotton is a soft fiber which can be extracted from cotton plants. After removal from the plant, the fibers are processed to remove seeds and wax, and then they are spun into threads. Cotton grows well in both tropical and warm temperate climates, and it can be cultivated across much of the inhabited portions of the world.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many civilizations recognized the value cotton very early in their development - examples include the Egyptians, (Asian) Indians and even some pre-Colombian American cultures. The Industrial Revolution saw the invention of the "Spinning Jenny" and cotton gin, which enabled mass production of cotton-based cloth. After these developments the demand for the plant fiber became almost insatiable, driving up labor demands for its cultivation across the world - leading to, among other things, the continuation of slavery in the United States into the mid-nineteenth century. Today, however, most cotton in western nations is harvested mechanically. It remains an important good worldwide.</English>

L'invention, &#224; la R&#233;volution industrielle, de la "Spinning Jenny" et de l'&#233;greneuse de coton, va permettre une production de masse de v&#234;tements. Apr&#232;s ce d&#233;veloppement, la demande pour cette fibre devient presque insatiable, incitant au d&#233;veloppement de sa culture &#224; travers le monde, et entra&#238;nant, entre autres choses, la poursuite de l'esclavage aux Etats-Unis au XIXe si&#232;cle. De nos jours, la plus grande partie des r&#233;coltes du monde occidental est effectu&#233;e m&#233;caniquement et le coton demeure un produit important dans le monde entier. </French>
		<German>Baumwolle ist eine weiche Faser, die aus der Baumwollpflanze gewonnen und vorwiegend in der Textilfertigung genutzt wird. Nach der Ernte werden die Samenhaare in einem ersten Verarbeitungsprozess zunchst von den Samen sowie von Wachsrckstnden befreit und dann zu Fden gesponnen. Besonders gut gedeiht die Baumwollpflanze in tropischem und warmem Klima, grundstzlich kann sie aber in den meisten bewohnten Gebieten der Erde angebaut werden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Viele Zivilisationen erkannten bereits sehr frh den Wert der Baumwolle, so zum Beispiel die gypter, die Inder sowie einige prkolumbianische Kulturen auf dem amerikanischen Kontinent. Doch erst die Erfindung der "Spinning Jenny" (Spinnmaschine) und der "Cotton Gin" (Egreniermaschine zur Entkrnung von Baumwolle) im Zeitalter der Industriellen Revolution ermglichte die Massenfertigung von Baumwolltextilien. In der darauf folgenden Zeit stieg die Nachfrage nach der Pflanzenfaser schier ins Unermessliche, so dass weltweit Unmengen von Arbeitskrften fr den Anbau der Baumwollpflanze bentigt wurden - dies war unter anderem auch ein Grund dafr, dass die Sklaverei in den Vereinigten Staaten bis Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts aufrechterhalten blieb. Heute wird Baumwolle, die nach wie vor zu den wichtigsten Handelsgtern der Welt gehrt, in den westlichen Lndern berwiegend mechanisch geerntet.</German>
		<Italian>Importante per la produzione dell'abbigliamento, il cotone  una fibra soffice che si estrae dalla pianta di cotone. Dopo essere state estratte dalla pianta, le fibre vengono trattate per privarle di semi e cera, quindi sono filate (tessute in fili). Il cotone cresce bene nei climi tropicali e in quelli temperati e perci&#242;  coltivabile in buona parte del mondo abitato.[PARAGRAPH:2]Molte civilt, tra cui Egizi, Indiani (d'Asia) e certe culture pre-colombiane, hanno apprezzato sin da subito il valore del cotone. La Rivoluzione Industriale vide l'introduzione del &quot;filatoio multiplo&quot; e della sgranatrice, che permisero la produzione di massa dei capi in cotone. In seguito a questi sviluppi, la domanda di cotone divenne quasi insaziabile, facendo impennare la domanda di lavoro nelle piantagioni di cotone in tutto il mondo. Questo port&#242;, tra le altre cose, alla continuazione della pratica della schiavit negli Stati Uniti fino alla met del diciannovesimo secolo. Oggi, invece, nelle nazioni occidentali il cotone  raccolto meccanicamente e rimane sempre un bene importante.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Importante para la produccin de tela, el algodn es una fibra suave que se extrae de la planta de algodn. Tras su extraccin, las fibras se procesan para quitarles las semillas y la cera y, a continuacin, se utilizan para formar hebras. El algodn se cultiva en climas tanto tropicales como clidos y puede producirse en buena parte de las regiones habitadas del mundo.[PARAGRAPH:2]Muchas civilizaciones reconocieron el valor del algodn en un momento muy temprano de su desarrollo. Entre los ejemplos ms caractersticos tenemos a los egipcios, los hindes e incluso algunas culturas precolombinas. La Revolucin Industrial asisti a la invencin de &quot;Jenny la hilandera&quot; y de la desmotadora, que permitan la produccin en serie de tela de algodn.  Tras estos inventos, la demanda de fibra de algodn se hizo casi insaciable y el cultivo de la planta se extendi por todo el mundo lo que, entre otras cosas, foment la supervivencia de la esclavitud en los Estados Unidos hasta el siglo XIX. En nuestros das, no obstante, en las naciones occidentales el algodn se recoge por medios mecnicos. Sigue siendo una mercanca importantsima en todo el mundo.</Spanish>

		<English>The Battlecarrier is an attempt to overcome one of the greatest weaknesses of a battleship: the vulnerabuility to squadrons. By incorporating a small facility to carry a squadron the battlecarrier can provide itself with cover from squadron attacks, or do such attacks itself when enemy squadrons are not present. The space required does, however, cause a small reduction in the amount of weaponry the ship can cary and provides a relatively large opening through the hull armor. This makes the battlecarrier inferior to a regular battleship in combat if it cannot use its carried squadron against the enemy, or if it is not carrying one.</English>

		<English>A nanoseparation system does everything that the standard nanoextraction upgrade does, and more. Through proprietary design improvements it is capable of simultaneously identifying and extracting a wider range of substances that are in the ore, including trace amounts of minerals and elements which a standard nanoextraction facility does not normally look for. It also has the ability to separate different isotopes of elements. This does not give any significant productivity boost to the star system, but it does provide an increase in commerce.</English>

		<English>A Public Broadcasting System is one of the most cost-effective ways for a planet to increase its income. Unlike the highly competitive and loosely regulated commercial satellite systems, a PBS operates in a more heavily regulated environment requiring a greater amount of the available bandwidth to be devoted to educational content and a reduced amount of advertising. This does not seem to reduce the benefits to commerce but does slightly increase the amount of research (some claim that it is because the less interesting content leads people to do anything to avoid it, for students this even includes homework).</English>

		<English>A Cryogenic Granary expands on the functionality of an ordinary granary with the addition of a cooling system. Food that can be frozen without damaging it is frozen and stored at very low temperatures; other foodstuff is stored at higher temperatures, but still mostly cooled below the normal room temperature of human habitats. The efficiency of this sort of system is greatly improved by use of vacuum engineering technologies which make these large scale storage facilities possible. The system also includes refrigerated transports and widely distributed flash freezing systems allowing crops to be preserved shortly after they are harvested..</English>
