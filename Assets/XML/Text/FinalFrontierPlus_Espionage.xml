		<English>[TAB]Interstellar Intelligence began as a heavily classified and redacted organization known officially as the "Center for Interstellar Intelligence", a research group inside the People's Democracy For Earth's labyrinthine intelligence apparatus. The Center for Interstellar Intelligence was a harmless sounding organization with an official mandate to study "how traditional surveillance methods have adapted in the context of interstellar travel"... or at least that's what it said on the official organization chart. In fact, the mission of CII was far more complex: the PDE Security Commission had realized that maintaining control over all of its far-flung colonies would become increasingly difficult, just as many empires on Earth ages ago had found it eventually too expensive to maintain their colonies in the 19th and 20th century. CAS was charged with ways to reduce the "human cost" of keeping order in space. This effort was given the codename "Project Panopticon".[NEWLINE][TAB]In order to keep their work as far from the public eye as possible, in 2263 AD the entire CII team was sent to the remote, heavily-classified colony of Oculus that had been founded just a year prior as a PDE military base in the stars. Accompanying them, to provide "protection" (the local PDE defense force were not given clearance for PROJECT PANOPTICON) were a number of special operations teams from the infamous, equally heavily classified Division Nine of the Security Commission. At first, things went smoothly; most of the colonists on Oculus were unaware of the presence of CII, and simply got on with the business of taming a new and alien world. But soon the CII team had deployed their remote monitoring infrastructure throughout the population, and had established complete and total surveillance on every citizen on the planet. This led to unrest, which, thanks to the nature of the total surveillance state, the directors of CII were easily able to suppress. Even before contact with Earth was lost, the intelligence agents, spooks, and special ops teams who had become colloqually known as "the Watchers" had become far more important to colony life than the People's Democracy of Earth. And since the CII's agents and leaders technically outranked the local PDE garrison, there was virtually no check on their power.[NEWLINE][TAB]When contact with Earth was lost, it barely effected life on Oculus. Director Shapiro maintained the illusion for a few years that the Watchers still answered to Earth, but eventually went through the formality of declaring herself civilian administrator of the colony in 2305 AD and rebranding her organization (dropping the "Center for" from her agency's name(. Work continued on the surveillance systems of Project Panopticon, and scouts were discreetly sent out to discover what had become of the PDE forces (who had vanished in search of Earth) and Earth's other colonies in the stars. When the scouts returned with news that the remaining human settlements were fractured and not united, planning immediately began to reunite humanity under one banner-- that of II. Colonial efforts were launched to spread the influence of the Watchers to other worlds; these were initially quite slow, as deploying the real-time FTL surveillance technology of Project Panopticon was far more expensive than the Security Commission back on Earth had originally hoped. But once such technology was set up, new colonies governed in exactly the same was as Oculus sprung up across the stars. Life on one of these colonies was quite good, as long as citizens did not mind that analysts back on Oculus had almost instantaneous access to everything they did or said: there was very little crime or corruption that could not instantly be dealt with. But it came at at a high price.[NEWLINE][TAB]Now, slowly building a cloaked fleet of warships and facing a galactic stage unaware of their presence, the Watchers prepare to reunify humanity-- by guile and spycraft if possible, but by force if necessary.</English>

She is the first to hold the title who was born on Oculus, and has even less nominal loyalty to Earth than her immediate predecessors.

		<English>Deploying Watcher field agents onto enemy worlds is a problem that the Research and Development divisions inside II turned a lot of attention to. They rejected traditional PDE designs for a stealth ship and created a far more expensive and better armed model that somehow managed to maintain the same stealth profile as its competition. In fact, a Stealth Cruiser's stealth systems are significantly superior to anything outside of II, and means that such a vessel is capable of maintaining stealth for far longer when closing range and attacking an enemy vessel.[NEWLINE]The first prototype Stealth Cruiser successfully trailed a Brotherhood supply convoy escorted by two Destroyers, waited until they were damaged by a radiation storm, destroyed them, stole valuable resources from the convoy, and managed to escape a fleet scrambled to investigate. The only good news for the navies of the other colonies is that a Stealth Cruiser is a considerable investment and thus a very rare sight on the battlefield.</English>
		<French>Deploying Watcher field agents onto enemy worlds is a problem that the Research and Development divisions inside II turned a lot of attention to. They rejected traditional PDE designs for a stealth ship and created a far more expensive and better armed model that somehow managed to maintain the same stealth profile as its competition. In fact, a Stealth Cruiser's stealth systems are significantly superior to anything outside of II, and means that such a vessel is capable of maintaining stealth for far longer when closing range and attacking an enemy vessel.[NEWLINE]The first prototype Stealth Cruiser successfully trailed a Brotherhood supply convoy escorted by two Destroyers, waited until they were damaged by a radiation storm, destroyed them, stole valuable resources from the convoy, and managed to escape a fleet scrambled to investigate. The only good news for the navies of the other colonies is that a Stealth Cruiser is a considerable investment and thus a very rare sight on the battlefield.</French>
